# Corner-Grocer
This project, Corner Grocer, reads a list of grocery items from a text file, counts how many times each item appears, and allows users to query specific item frequencies, print all items with counts, or display a histogram. It solves the problem of tracking and visualizing item frequency in a simple, readable way using C++ data structures.
