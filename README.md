# CS 210 Project: Corner Grocer
**Author:** John Distel  
**Course:** CS 210 - Programming Languages  

## Project Summary
This project reads a grocery list from a text file, counts how often each item appears, and displays that data in multiple ways. It helps users quickly identify purchase frequency, showcasing file input/output and map-based data structures in C++.

## Reflection
- **What I did well:** I implemented efficient use of `std::map` and file I/O while keeping the program readable and modular. - **Enhancements:** Iâ€™d add input validation and case-insensitive searches for better usability.  
- **Challenges:** Getting the file writing logic to behave consistently required testing and careful stream management.  
- **Transferable skills:** Improved understanding of classes, I/O operations, and data structures.  
- **Maintainability:** Structured code into logical functions with clear comments to ensure readability and adaptability.
